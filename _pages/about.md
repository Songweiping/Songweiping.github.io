Since Sept. 2016, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/). I have also been closely working with Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/), who is my supervior at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) during Sept. 2018 - Sept. 2019.
